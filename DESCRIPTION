Description: Geometric reliability analysis for piles. The PileBetaGR develops for geotechnical engineers to perform geometric reliability analyses for piles at a site. Firstly, observed load-displacement data at various site globally are presented, and there are 780 measured curves across 31 sites. The load displacement data at different load levels for each curve are presented. Secondly, regression parameters of loading test databases are derived. For the CFG pile, containing length, diameter, maximum loading, maximum settlement, Kur, and curve regression parameters (p1 , p2 , h1 , and h2); for the pile-soil intermediate (PSI) containing bearing plate area, maximum bearing pressure, maximum settlement, Kur, and regression parameters (p1 , p2 , h1 , and h2). For the other piles containing location, site, type, No, length, diameter, slenderness, regression parameters (p1 , p2), maximumload, ID. Thirdly, the source code of the geometric reliability analyses for piles at a site are provided.
